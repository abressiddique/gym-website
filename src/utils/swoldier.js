        description: 'Standing with the bar over your feet, grip it overhand shoulder width apart, while ensuring you back remains straight throughout the entire exercise. Begin the lift by straightening your legs, dragging the bar up your shins, and as soon as the bar is above knee height, straighten your torso and lean back to heavy the bar off the ground. In reverse, you start standing tall, and with a micro bend in your knees, you hinge at the hips (maintaining a straight) back until the bar is over you knees, at which point your hips stop hinging and your knees start bending until the bar touches the ground. This exercise may also be done with a sumo stance.',
